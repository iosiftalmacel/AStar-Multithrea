# Pathfinding Multithread

Simple implementation of the AStar algorithm for Unity. The pathfinding is done on another thread so it will not impact the main thread.

## Example
The part in yellow are the nodes that are computed and the part in magenta is the path. This is a 232x232 weighted node map.
